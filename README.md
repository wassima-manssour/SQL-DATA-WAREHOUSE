# Sales Data Warehouse Development Using SQL Server: An End-to-End ETL & Data Modeling Solution
_Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics._

## üîç Overview
This repository contains a practical implementation of a Data Warehouse project designed to consolidate sales data from ERP and CRM systems, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making. Built using **SQL Server**, this project demonstrates skills in **Data Architecture Design, ETL Development, Data Modeling, and Documentation**. 

The project involves:

- Extracting and loading raw data using **SQL Server**.
- Processing and transforming data using **T-SQL (Transact-SQL)**.
- Storing cleaned and integrated data in a structured **Star Schema Model**.
- Automating ETL processes using **Stored Procedures**.
- Visualizing data using **Power BI**.
- Managing workflow and documentation using **Notion & Git**.

The data pipeline follows the Bronze, Silver, and Gold architecture pattern, ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the process.

## üéØ Project Objectives
### Objective

The purpose of this project is to build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** to integrate sales data from various sources, enabling comprehensive analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

### Specifications

- **Data Sources:** Load data from two source systems: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management ) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Ensure data accuracy and consistency by cleaning and addressing quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Merge both sources into a cohesive, user-friendly data model, using a Star Schema, optimized for efficient analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focus solely on the most recent dataset; data historization is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and thorough documentation of the data model to assist both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

---
## üìå Features

- **Data Integration:** Combines multiple sources (ERP & CRM) into a unified data model.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Structured approach with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for data ingestion, cleaning, and modeling.
- **Data Modeling:** Star Schema with well-defined dimensions and facts.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive explanations for each layer, including data flow diagrams and SQL scripts.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
The data architecture of this project follows a Medallian three-layered approach (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to ensure efficient data processing, integration, and analytical reporting. The architecture is designed using SQL Server and structured to enhance data quality and accessibility.

**The data layers are described as follows:**
![Data Layers](imgs/data_layers.jpg)

### **Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion)**: 
  - Stores unprocessed data **as-in**, ingested directly from source systems (ERP & CRM) as CSV files.
  - The data is imported into a SQL Server Database with no transformation to maintain raw integrity.
### **Silver Layer(Data Integration & Cleansing)**:
  - Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to enhance data quality and consistency.
  - Adds metadata columns (e.g dwh_created_date)
  - Ensures data is reliable, accurate, and ready for analytical modeling.
### **Gold Layer (Analytical Data Model)**:
  - Contains business-ready data structured into a Star Schema Model optimized for reporting and analytics.
  - Fact and dimension tables are created to support high-performance querying and efficient data retrieval.
  - Ready for visualization tools like Power BI to generate insightful reports.

## üìà Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The tables from both ERP and CRM systems are linked together through common keys such as Customer IDs and Product IDs. The integration process ensures data consistency and accuracy before proceeding to the modeling phase.
The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the tables within the Data Warehouse:
