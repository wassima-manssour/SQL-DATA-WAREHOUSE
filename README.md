# Sales Data Warehouse Development Using SQL Server: An End-to-End ETL & Data Modeling Solution
_Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics._

## üîç Overview
This repository contains a practical implementation of a Data Warehouse project designed to consolidate sales data from ERP and CRM systems, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making. Built using **SQL Server**, this project demonstrates skills in **Data Architecture Design, ETL Development, Data Modeling, and Documentation**. 

The project involves:

- Extracting and loading raw data using **SQL Server**.
- Processing and transforming data using **T-SQL (Transact-SQL)**.
- Storing cleaned and integrated data in a structured **Star Schema Model**.
- Automating ETL processes using **Stored Procedures**.
- Visualizing data using **Power BI**.
- Managing workflow and documentation using **Notion & Git**.

The data pipeline follows the Bronze, Silver, and Gold architecture pattern, ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the process.

## üéØ Project Objectives
### Objective

The purpose of this project is to build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** to integrate sales data from various sources, enabling comprehensive analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

### Specifications

- **Data Sources:** Load data from two source systems: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management ) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Ensure data accuracy and consistency by cleaning and addressing quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Merge both sources into a cohesive, user-friendly data model, using a Star Schema, optimized for efficient analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focus solely on the most recent dataset; data historization is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and thorough documentation of the data model to assist both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
