# Silver Layer (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
The Silver Layer focuses on transforming raw data from the Bronze Layer to ensure data quality, consistency, and usability for analytical purposes. This process involves data cleansing, normalization, enrichment, and standardization.

## üìå Technical Details

- **Data Cleansing:**
    - Removing duplicates.
    - Handling missing values by either **imputation** or **deletion**.
    - Resolving data type mismatches.
- **Standardization & Normalization:**
    - Converting data formats (e.g., date formats).
    - Standardizing text fields (e.g., casing, removing special characters o rempty spaces).
- **Data Enrichment:**
    - Adding new attributes from calculations (e.g., `Total_Sales = Quantity * Unit_Price`).
